# Simple Face Detection

Detect faces in images using a Single Shot Detector architecture with [Blazeface](https://sites.google.com/view/perception-cv4arvr/blazeface) custome encoder. Blazeface is a fast and light-weight neural face detection that runs on mobile GPU.

The pretrained model is based on [MediaPipe FaceDetection](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/solutions/face_detection.html) that can detect multiple faces, with each face contains 6 keypoints.

More background information about the model, as well as its performance characteristics can be found here:
